CBS, formally known as Curly Braced Syntax (CBS, currently only called "CBS"), is a syntax that is used to write simple macro scripts for {{gettempvar::production_name}}.
It can be used almost any textboxes in {{gettempvar::production_name}}, such as character description, lorebook, regex script, trigger script, and other textboxes.
It can be mixed with plain text, like "[[char]] is a character", or "Hello [[user]]".
It's syntax is like [[char]], or with arguments like [[random::arg1::arg2::arg3]]. it can also be nested like [[random::[[user]]::[[char]]]].
It also has a block syntax, starts with [[#block <A>]] and ends with [[/block]] or simplified [[/]].

- Reroll: Rerolling a message means to ask the AI to generate a new response, instead of using the previous one. It is used when you don't like the previous response, or you want to see a different response. also known as "regenerate" or "regenerate response".
- Unroll: Unrolling a message means to ask the AI to return the previous response, which is a response before the reroll. It is used when you prefer the previous response, or you want to return to the previous message. also known as "unreroll" or "unregenerate".
